# 📦 Daily Flutter Packages

## 📘 About the Project
I created this repository to strengthen my Flutter skills by exploring **useful and unique Flutter packages**.  
This initiative helps me understand third-party tools better, improve integration techniques, and build a rich resource for future projects.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Every day, I explore a new Flutter package and implement a small example or feature using it.
- Each example is pushed as a separate commit in this repository.
- This repo is both a **learning journal** and a **contribution to the Flutter community**.

---

## ✅ Packages Implemented

- [x] **fluttertoast** (Added on: *April 21, 2025*) – *Show toast messages easily*
- [ ] Upcoming packages (Stay tuned...)

## 🧠 Why This Project?

- To stay **consistent** with hands-on practice
- To **master** the use of third-party packages in real-world apps
- To **build** a reliable reference for developers and future projects
